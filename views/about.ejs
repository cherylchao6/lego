              My name is Tzu Han Chao, but you can call me Cheryl. I have an
              outgoing and lively personality and I really enjoy playing
              basketball. I don't have much interest in LEGO, but I created this
              project because of the assignment. I hope the professor won't
              deduct points for my honesty. It was nice to meet everyone, and I
              wish you all a wonderful day.
